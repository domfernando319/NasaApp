# NasaApp

## About
🌎 NasaApp is a ReactJS application that leverages NASA API and served as a quick hands-on experience with 3rd party API integration. 
Inspired by developer smoljames, NasaApp explores themes of space 🌌 and education📖.

The artifacts generated are truly incredible and informative!

## Technologies
- ⚛️**ReactJS:** using VITE bundler
- 🌎**NASA API:** Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API
- 🖌️**CSS:** Basic styling. A pain!!!

## Take-Aways
- **Styling and CSS:** Initially struggled with layout consistency and responsiveness. This prompted a review of CSS visual cues at [https://cssreference.io/](https://cssreference.io/).
- **Local Cache Implementation:** Small hiccup implementing a local cache function for the fetched API results. Try-catch blocks and console logs quickly led to a solution.
