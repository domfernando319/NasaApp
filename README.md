# NasaApp

## Abstract
NasaApp is a ReactJS application that leverages NASA API's Astronomy Picture of the Day. This project serves as a practical hands-on experience for API integration and refresher on ReactJS fundamentals, CSS styling. Inspired by developer smoljames, NasaApp was created to explore a simple SPACE education app for casual learning. The artifacts generated are truly incredible and informative!

## Technologies Used
- **ReactJS:**: using VITE bundler
- **NASA API:** Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API
- **CSS:** Basic styling. A pain!!!

## Challenges Encountered
- **Styling and CSS:** Initially struggled with layout consistency and responsiveness. This prompted a review of CSS visual cues at [https://cssreference.io/](https://cssreference.io/).
- **Local Cache Implementation:** Small hiccup implementing a local cache function for the fetched API results. Try-catch blocks and console logs quickly led to a solution.
