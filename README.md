# NasaApp

## Abstract
NasaApp is a ReactJS application that leverages NASA's API to display the Astronomy Picture of the Day. This project serves as a practical learning experience for API integration, ReactJS fundamentals, and basic CSS styling.

## Introduction
Inspired by tutorials from smoljames on YouTube, NasaApp was created to explore space-themed applications using real data from NASA. The primary goal was to build a simple, educational app that fetches and displays daily astronomy pictures.

## Technologies Used
- **ReactJS:** Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **NASA API:** Specifically, the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API.
- **CSS:** Basic styling to enhance visual presentation and responsiveness.

## Challenges Encountered
- **Styling and CSS:** Initially struggled with layout consistency and responsiveness. This prompted a review of CSS best practices.
- **Local Cache Implementation:** Faced difficulties implementing a local cache for API results. Used try-catch blocks and debugging to ensure smooth caching and error handling.

## Reflection
Developing NasaApp was a valuable learning experience. It deepened understanding of ReactJS, API integration, and frontend development challenges. It also underscored the importance of responsive design and error handling in web applications.
